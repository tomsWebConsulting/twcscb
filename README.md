Tom's Web Consulting Squarespace Code Bits

This is a
[monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo)
of code for adding various effects to Squarespace v7.1 and v7.0 sites.

## Note

For those of you that may be familiar with
[Tom's Web Consulting Squarespace Library](https://github.com/tomsWebConsulting/twcsl),
twcscb is not like twcsl. The code bits here are just thrown in with no real
documentation. That doesn't mean there isn't useful code here!

There may be some documentation in the Squarespace Forum. Usually I have to do
some explaining of where things are to be installed and such. You can try
searching for the code in the forum. Again this is fast and loose so there may
be some. Maybe not.

Did my code help you build a site for your client and make you some dough? How
about a slice of the bread for Tom?
